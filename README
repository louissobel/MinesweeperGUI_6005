This is a web interface for the 6.005 minesweeper project.

I wrote it because I didn't want to write  unit tests, hopefully it will help debug for the final submission.

It runs a websocket server using socket.io and node.js.
It pretty much pipes messages sent to that websocket to the java minesweeper server running.

It also runs the python built-in file server to serve the client and its static files.

default settings:
	- minsweeper port: 4444
	- websocket port: 4445
	- webserver port: 4443

a little perl script reads the config file and starts everything up.

so to run:

perl minesweeperWebGUI.pl [config_file]

if config_file is omitted, it will look for a file called 'config'

========================
To use (as is):
	you need to add 2 commands to the minesweeper server
	
	1.
		command:
			size
		response:
			size:<boardsize>
		(where board size is the integer width or height of the square board)
	
	2.
		command:
			pcount
		response:
			pcount:<player count>
		(where player count is the integer number of players)

also, the java server should be running before starting up anything else


=========================
Notes:
You need node.js, python, and a WebSocket enabled browser to run this
It will work on Mac, should work on linux

I know that the startup script won't work on windows, because it forks, but the individual components still might

Also, there is code in here to handle an additional square character (besides, '-',' ', or '[1-8]'), namely 'o', which I used
to represent an unexploded bomb (to help with debugging the file reader and the game itself). If you implement this in 
your java code, you will be able to see where all the bombs are located.
